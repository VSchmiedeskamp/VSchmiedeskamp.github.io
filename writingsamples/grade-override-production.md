###Context for the grade override procedure
The Lake Washington School District uses two software applications to manage student grade data. Instructors use one application, StandardsScore, to record and post grades online. Office staff export these grades into a second application called Skyward. Skyward formats these grades in a printer-friendly format for quarterly reports. 

In the event that grade data are not transferred into Skyward, or are not transferred correctly, instructors must manually adjust grades in Skyward. This process is called a grade override. This must be done after the data is exported into Skyward but before the reports are scheduled to print, usually a window of 7 hours.

During this 7-hour span, instructors spend 5 hours working directly with students. The other 2 hours encompass planning, reporting, meetings, and other normally-scheduled duties in addition to this manual data correction. 

Given the number of distractions and demands during this brief override period, it is important that instructions for completing these changes are clear and direct.

The final improvements made to these Grade Override Instructions increase readability, scannability, and shortens the completion time of the desired task.

###Audience analysis
Grade reporting season is an infrequent yet high-stress time of the year for instructors. Not only are they processing large volumes of student assessments, but they are also preparing for the next quarter of instruction set to begin two days after the previous quarter ends. This is a large volume of work. New instructors unfamiliar with this quarterly spike in workload have voiced the need for assistance with software-oriented tasks that only arise during these reporting periods. They typically have to complete this task without training.

The low frequency of the task, combined with navigating unfamiliar software under high pressure, means that teachers need clear and targeted help with this override process.

###Legacy document critique
The following image shows the first page of the five-page Grade Override Instructions document periodically emailed to Lake Washington School District instructors. These instructions are not available through the Skyward in-application Help menu, nor are they posted to the district portal.

This document has a number of features that can be improved.
 - The steps for completing this procedure are 5 unnumbered screen grabs.
 - Monochromatic black-and-white screen grabs make the instructions difficult to read when scanning the document.
 - Introductory information and steps are in a comment box overlay, which is hard to find on the word-heavy        background. 
 - Instructions in the comment boxes are not enumerated, making them difficult to differentiate between the explanatory text displayed on the same comment box.
 - Instructions are centered in the overlay feature, leaving a jagged left edge that is distracting to the eye.

###Planned improvements 
The following changes should improve readability, thereby helping users complete the Grade Override process more quickly and with fewer moments of frustration:
 - Orient new users to the Override process with a brief introductory statement.
 - Place steps in the procedure on a white background next to the screen grabs.
 - Number steps to provide a sense of progression.
 - Include color screen grabs to update the document for a more modern audience, focusing on only the relevant elements of the screen.
- Point more experienced users to supplemental features such as Comments in a separate document or page

###Usability testing method
There are a large number of new staff members at one work site in the Lake Washington School District. I plan to seek out new staff at this site who have not completed this Grade Override process before, or who have only had very limited contact with this procedure.

I will ask these users to navigate to the manual Grade Override page during the open window, and complete the Grade Override process with the improved document. I will time how long it takes them to complete the process, and record points of frustration and backtracking. Afterward I will ask them what they found confusing about the process, and what they did and did not find helpful about the document.

I hope to see the following results based on the updated documentation:
 - task completion time comparable to a more experienced user
 - few to no moments of verbalised frustration
 - no instances of backtracking through the UI. 

###Usability testing results
No respondents to my requests for volunteers were completely unfamiliar with the Grade Override process. All had only completed this process once within the last 6 months, and no respondents had access to the legacy documentation. When asked how they completed the Grade Override process on their first attempt, all reported that they learned how to complete the process through trial and error, or asked another colleague to help them. This indicates that the amount of time to complete the grade override process was longer than necessary.

The following table illustrates the results of a test with one user and the conclusions drawn from that test.

|--------------------------+----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| *Criteria*    | *Result*    |   *Conclusions and recommendations*   |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Task completion in a span of time comparable to a more experienced user. | Test participant completed the task in under 1 minute 30 seconds. More practiced users of this software can complete the task in around 1 minute. | This is an acceptable difference in user speed. The gap here will likely close as the user gains familiarity with the UI.
| Few to no moments of verbalised frustration. | Test participant scanned the document quickly and easily, using mostly the headings and screen grabs. When they got to the “Comments” section, they verbalized that they did not need that step and stopped reading. | Comments section is potentially not needed. It does not get in the way of the supertask. |
| No instances of backtracking through the UI. | The participant preemptively reset a grading period menu option not mentioned in the procedure. The participant also clicked the Save button at the end, also not included in the procedure. These were not backtracks, but clearly indicated missing steps in the procedure. | The first of these steps will be added to the final draft of the document. The ‘Save’ button has been removed from the UI since the time of this test, so this step is unnecessary. |

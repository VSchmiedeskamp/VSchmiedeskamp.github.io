{% newthought 'I am a technical writer and writing instructor'%} with 10 years experience teaching, designing curriculum, and creating documents for a wide range of users. 

My golden rule: all texts can and should be user-centered. Graphics should invite skimming without compromising content. Interactivity should be incorporated whenever possible. Short and sweet is usually best. But most of all, a good narrative can make even dry content relatable and readable.

In my free time I am a runner, reader, traveller, ukulele novice, and sci-fi film buff.
